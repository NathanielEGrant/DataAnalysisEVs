Electric Vehicles and Their Impact on Air Pollution

In this project we used public data to answer the hypothesis on whether or not the recent influx of electric vehicles in the market helped to have an effect on air pollution. To help decipher data we used libraries such as pandas and numpy to manage the raw data and libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels to help with data visualization.
